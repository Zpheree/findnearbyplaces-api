This repo will contain the necessary code to complete the project for ISTA 330. It will be done
  in two parts. Part one will contain the necessary code to support the backend-serivces. This
  will include inserting and getting app info from a database. Part two will contain the
  necessary code for the frontend-services. Together they will make a yelp-like app, which will
  be deployed on Heroku. The database will be a Postgres SQL database.
